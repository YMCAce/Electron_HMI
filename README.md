#Electron_HMI

## How to use the project after cloning

Due to the size of the __node_modules__ file using __Electron__ the project size is bigger than the allowed size to upload on <ins>GitHub<ins>.

The __node_modules__ is ignored in the __.gitignore__ file

Use the **npm install** command to rebuild your __node_modules_ directory.
All dependencys for the rebuild ar kept in the __package.json__ file inside the project.
